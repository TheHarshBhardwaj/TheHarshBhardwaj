### About Me
**Creator | Designer | Code Enthusiast**  
**Doing whatever I like - coding, designing, or debugging... sometimes all at once.**  
**Building:** Currently building things that will probably make me question my life choices later.

---

### Fun Facts
- **Lifting Weights.** So my code doesn't collapse under pressure.
- **My Code Works!** ... Until I refresh the page.
- **Procrastination Level:** Writing README instead of actual code.

---

### Let's Connect!
- **GitHub:** [@TheHarshBhardwaj](https://github.com/TheHarshBhardwaj)
- **LinkedIn:** *Coming soon... unless I procrastinate.*

---

### Open For Collaborations!
I usually work alone, but if you have a cool idea, I might just make an exception. No promises though.  
**Warning:** I'm a perfectionist - so be prepared for endless revisions and tweaks!

Thanks for dropping by! Now, back to coding... or just contemplating life's mysteries.
